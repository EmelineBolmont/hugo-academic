Emeline Bolmont's research focuses on two aspects related to planets around low-mass stars: the simulation of the orbit and rotation of planets (in particular in multi-planet systems) and the simulation of planetary climates.  
 
She obtained her PhD from the University of Bordeaux, France, where she worked on the history and habitability of exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars and brown dwarfs at the Laboratoire d’astrophysique de Bordeaux (with Sean N. Raymond and Franck Selsis). She then did a two-year postdoctoral stay in the University of Namur, Belgium, with Anne-Sophie Libert, where she worked on deepening her knowledge on planetary climates. Finally, after two years as a postdoctoral researcher in the CEA, Saclay, France, where she worked on the modeling of tides with Stéphane Mathis, she joined the Observatory of Geneva as an assistant professor in November 2018.
